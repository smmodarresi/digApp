Drilling application Project :

This is an Ionic-Vue-SQLite project that I created to demonstrate my skills in building mobile apps using the Ionic framework, Vue.js, and SQLite database.

Getting Started :

To run this project locally, you'll need to have the Ionic CLI and Vue CLI installed on your machine. You can install them by running:

Copy
